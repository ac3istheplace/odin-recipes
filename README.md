This project will be a basic recipe website. This is to show my beginning skills of HTML, and later on of CSS. 

Skills I will be showing include writing a boilerplate, using headers, paragraphs, italics/bolds/strikethrough/etc, links, and images. 

This will be my first HTML project while following The Odin Project's course.
