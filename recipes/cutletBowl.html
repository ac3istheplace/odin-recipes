        <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> What <em>is</em> katsudon? You may be wondering why you clicked for a pork cutlet bowl recipe, and now see the word katsudon. That's because they're the same! Katsudon <strong> (pronounced cot-soo-doan) </strong> is the Japanese name of this dish. It's a (normally pork) cutlet coated in breadcrumbs and deep fried, on a bed of rice and egg, with onions and a sweet and savory sauce! </p>
            <p> Let's get into the recipe, starting with what ingredients you need. This recipe makes 2 bowls, so be sure to adjust ingredient amounts as needed! </p>
            <p> If you do not have leftover tonkatsu, follow my recipe <a href="../recipes/tonkatsu.html"> here</a>, as you need pre-cooked pork for this recipe! </p>
        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> <em> 3 </em> large eggs </li>
                <li> <em> 1/3 cup </em> dashi stock </li>
                <li> <em> 2 teaspoons </em> granulated sugar </li>
                <li> <em> 1 tablespoon </em> soy sauce </li>
                <li> <em> 1 tablespoon </em> sake </li>
                <li> <em> 1/4 teaspoon </em> potato starch </li>
                <li> <em> 2 teaspoons </em> vegetable oil </li>
                <li> <em> 1/2 </em> small onion, thinly sliced </li>
                <li> <em> 2 </em> thin tonkatsu <strong> (pork cutlets)</strong> </li>
                <li> <em> 1 </em> scallion <strong> (optional garnish) </strong> </li>
                <li> <em> 2 </em> bowls of cooked rice <strong>(white suggested) </strong> </li>
            </ul>
        <h3> Steps </h3>
            <ol> 
                <li> Break the <strong> eggs (3) </strong> into a bowl and partially mix until yolks are broken but still somewhat separate from the whites. </li>
                <li> Add the <strong> dashi (1/3 cup), sugar (2 tsp), soy sauce (1 tbsp), sake (1 tbsp), and potato starch (1/4 tsp) </strong> to a bowl and mix until combined. </li>
                <li> Add the <strong> oil (2 tsp) </strong> and <strong> onion (1/2 small) </strong> to a non-stick frying pan on medium-high heat. Saute the onions until soft and beginning to brown. </li>
                <li> Push onions to edge of pan and add the <strong> tonkotsu (2) </strong> in the center. </li>
                <li> Pour the sauce from <strong> step 2 </strong> on/around the cutlet and cover for 1 minute to let sauce thicken (and the katsu reheat if left over). </li>
                <li> Remove the lid and flip the katsu over. Pour <strong> egg </strong> all over/around the katsu and sprinkle on the <strong> green onions </strong>. Cover and steam until the egg is a little less cooked than you want. By the time it gets to the table, the residual heat cooks it the rest of the way. </li>
                <li> Set your bowls by laying a bed of the <strong> cooked white rice </strong> (follow instructions on rice package to cook properly). Cover rice with the tonkatsu/egg mix from your pan, and add any remaining sauce on top. </li>
            </ol>
