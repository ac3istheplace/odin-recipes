        <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> Tonkatsu is basically just a cut of pork (normally thin cutlets) that is breaded with panko, which are japanese-style breadcrumbs. They have larger crumbs, which makes a light, crispy coating. This recipe will go over the oven-baked version, rather than deep-fried. I like this method better so I don't have to worry about watching the cutlets while they cook, and I can prep/start making my <a href="../recipes/cutletBowl.html"> Katsudon</a>. </p>
